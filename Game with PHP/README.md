MemoryGame
==========

Memory Game is a single player game written using HTML5 and Javascript. Here the player needs to match the similar symbols hidden behind the tiles. 
The idea for this game has been from the old fashioned miniclip flash games that we used to play during our childhood.
Since the game has been completely written in HTML5 and Javascript, its expected to work completely only in the latest,
webkit browsers.

Update
------

* Added facility to track top 10 users who won the game using PHP and MySQL database.
